# I am starting to use git more seriously now
In a few days, I will be uploaded some code files here. 
It has been exactly 0 days since I made this readme file, but I will pretend like it's time to add some source code.

**Oh side note**: I will be document some git commands here as I learn how to use it

- git help command -> Gets help from the manual pages
