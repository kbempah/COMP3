# I am starting to use git more seriously now
In a few days, I will be uploaded some code files here. 
It has been exactly 0 days since I made this readme file, but I will pretend like it's time to add some source code.

**Oh side note**: I will be documenting some git help information here for easy reference as I learn how to use it

- git help *command* -> Gets help on *command* from the manual pages.
- git diff -> shows items that have been modified but not staged/indexed. Essentially shows you the diff between . and staging area.
- git diff --staged -> shows items that will be included in the next commit.
- git rm *file* -> removes *file* from tracked directory. the git rm --cached option will stop tracking *file* but keep it in directory.
- git mv -> used to rename/move git-tracked files.
